- random note
- random articulation
- goal: maximum tempo, even rhythm, perfect intonation, good tone

# of notes controlled by user. as they get more advanced they can increase the notes.
maybe provide metronome and playback as reference

maybe also extra goal of playing with lowest possible fingering as well

add metronome, playback, and tuner

// add articulation
// add metronome
// add tuner
// add # of notes input
// add playback; maybe hide visual output?
